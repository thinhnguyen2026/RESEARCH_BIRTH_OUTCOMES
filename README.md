# Birth Outcomes Among Hispanic Population in the U.S.: Trends, Variation, and Determinants

Project summary
This research analyzes 9,000,000+ National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) birth records to study trends, variation, and determinants of birth outcomes among the Hispanic population in the U.S. The work includes extensive data cleaning, feature engineering across socioeconomic, behavioral, and medical variables, exploratory visualization, and predictive modeling.

Key contributions
- Cleaned and managed missing data and outliers across 9M+ records; encoded categorical and derived features for downstream analysis.  
- Created 25+ visualizations using pandas and Matplotlib to illustrate trends and key relationships.  
- Trained and evaluated 12 classification tree models to identify risk factors and predict adverse birth outcomes.  
- Coâ€‘authored an MDPI paper reporting results and risk insights for Hispanic mothers (https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/22/9/1325), which has reached 1,500+ readers.

Tech stack
Python (pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn), Jupyter, Git.

Deliverables
Notebooks with EDA and modeling, visualizations, model artifacts, and the published MDPI article.
